# Language classifier with deep learning
This is a deep learning project inspired from a tutorial on thoughtful machine learning.
It classifies inputted text by giving it a language label among 7 languages.
To run it make sure you got sklearn, numpy ... and then type "python3 run.py" in your terminal.
Make sure you type a text that is long enough ( fetch a text on the internet)...
