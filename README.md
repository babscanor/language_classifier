# Language classifier with deep learning
This is a deep learning project inspired from a tutorial on thoughtful machine learning.
It classifies inputed text by giving it a language label among 7 languages. It is based on the number of population of each given 
character in the inputed text.
To run it make sure you got sklearn, numpy ... and then type "python3 run.py" in your terminal.
Make sure you type a text that is long enough ( fetch a text on the internet)... now I hope it will work well lol
